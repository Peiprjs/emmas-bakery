Program: 2S2 
## Evaluation
Yield: 500g theoretical, NaN practice.  \n
Good crunch on the outside, very cronchy, not too thick. \n 
Light in colour on the outside.  \n 
Soft, white and fluffy on the inside. Pillowy!  \n 
Taste is quite good, it's just white bread. Maybe a bit salty? 

## Future research
Decrease salt by 20%
