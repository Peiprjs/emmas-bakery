Program:  1S3
/!\ Was very liquidy too late. I had to bake it at 180C for 10 minutes after machine bake due to it still being very much raw on the inside.

## Evaluation
Final yield: Expected: 550g, Actual: 513.3g 
Good taste, but cake-y texture.
There was too much garlic taste.
Cheese flavour was barely noticeable.

## Future research
Try half the amount of butter and cuts next times.
